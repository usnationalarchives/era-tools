# era-tools

## Overview
ERA Tools are collection of tools that can be used for processing archival artifacts. They run in a self-contained ‘digital processing environment’ in ERA 2.0. The tools can be run to transform, glean metadata from, and generate reports on the uploaded archival artifacts. The ERA tools interact with ERA 2.0 using an API.  The Mission of the Electronic Record Archives 2.0 is to:
  1. Provide archivists with the ability to discover and access archived materials in context.  
  2. Provide archivists with powerful tools for processing digital records for preservation and eventual public access, 
  3. Provide agencies with a framework to schedule and transfer all records, paper and electronic, and 
  4. Leverage high performance and storage at  a massive scale by using a cloud-based architecture.

## Purpose of this Repository
This repository contains the all ERA tools that can be run in the ERA 2.0 environment. In addition to being a catalog of tools, this repository allows other NARA projects and members of the public to make use of the  underlying code that is used in the various tools. The tools range from calculating fixity, extracting zip files, and identifying MIME types to name a few. 

## Getting started on a new ERA Tool
To develop a new ERA tool, please refer to the ‘HelloWorld’ ERA tool project and follow the directions there.
